### 👋 Hi there, I'm @spbavarva

🔐 I'm passionate about Security Engineering, AppSec, and DevSecOps.

💡 I enjoy working on hands-on projects that involve threat modeling, secure system design, and building secure CI/CD pipelines. Recently, I've been diving into SOC automation, SIEM workflows, and exploring how AI can be used in security.

🚀 I’m always open to collaborating on security projects, research, or anything cool in the offensive/defensive security space.

📝 I also write blogs on Medium to share what I learn and give back to the community.
