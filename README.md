### Hi there, I'm Sneh Bavarva aka @mido

Doing security stuffs and learning about Security Engineering, Incident Responding, DFIR, AppSec, and DevSecOps.

Recently, I've been diving into SOC automation, SIEM workflows, and exploring how AI can be used in security.

Open to collaborating on security projects, research, or anything cool in the offensive/defensive security space!

I also write blogs on my website and Medium to share what I learn and give back to the community. Oh and I also started my own newsletter!
